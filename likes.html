            <p>Since the rise of man, the crab-people of clawguglia have hid below the surface: watching, waiting - planning for the day they can  once again crab-walk under the sun. In the deepest depths of the ocean the echoes of hammers and clang of crab machinery can be heard stirring to life. In the darkest forests the animals stir and the ground trembles.  The wait is over, the crab-people are here, and they are delicious.  </p>
